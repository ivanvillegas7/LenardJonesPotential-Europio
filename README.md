# SolidMelting-Europio

This project simulates the melting of a solid under a Lennard-Jones potential.

To run the simulation, download the files y folder "Code" and store it with a file named "input.txt" in the same Python project. Run the main code and the simulation will run.

The simulation will generate a histogram of the velocity in each direction (X, Y, Z), a graph to check energy conservation and a file "output.txt" to check your input data in order you can remember them. It will also produce a file named "movie.AXSF" in order to use it in XCrySDen and generate a movie of the simulation.

Our generated graphs will be in folder "Plots" and the files will be stored in folder "Files".
