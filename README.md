# Interacting gas - Europio

This project simulates the interactions of a gas under a Lennard-Jones potential.

To run the simulation, download the files y folder "Code" and store it with a file named "input.txt" in the same Python project. Run the main code and the simulation will be played.

The simulation will generate a histogram of the velocity in each direction (X, Y, Z), a graph to check energy conservation and a file "output_conditions.txt" to check your input data in order you can remember them. It will also produce a file named "outout_movie.AXSF" in order to use it in XCrySDen and generate a movie of the simulation. We were unable to upload "outout_movie.AXSF" because it is too heavy. However, you can find a lighter version with 100 steps.

Our generated graphs will be in folder "Plots" and the files will be stored in folder "Files".
